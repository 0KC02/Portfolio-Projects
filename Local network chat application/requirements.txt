# No external dependencies required
# This application uses only Python standard library:
# - socket (for network communication)
# - threading (for concurrent client handling)
# - tkinter (for GUI - comes with Python on most systems)
# - json (for message serialization)
# - datetime (for timestamps)

# If tkinter is not available on your system:
# On Linux (Debian/Ubuntu): sudo apt-get install python3-tk
# On Linux (Fedora): sudo dnf install python3-tkinter
# On macOS: Usually pre-installed with Python
# On Windows: Usually pre-installed with Python
